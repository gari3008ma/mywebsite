<ul>
    <li>Myocardial Damage Evaluation using ST segment and de-trended fluctuation analysis:<br> i)Used algorithms and Matlab Code for developing ECG monitoring system focusing on the measurement of heart rate and continuous ST segment monitoring to detect ST changes which may be ischemic episodes.</br>
        ii)Used hundreds of ECG files for De-trending the ECG data to analyse fluctuation in ECG.iii)Technology Used :Matlab,Physionet databases .Team Size -2</li>
    <li>Heart Disease Detection System:i)Heart Disease Prediction based on artificial neural network and Bayesian classifier<br>ii)Technology Used :Matlab,Patient data from physionet.org .
        Team Size :Self as part of summer project</br></li>
    <li>Web based hospital Management System: i) Developed a system which keeps record of its all Patient i.e. their date of joining, address, departments etc.ii)Any Patient can check his/her details any time. Right to make changes in database is given according to his designation.iii) Technologies used :- MySQL Database, JSP for server side, Hibernate framework, Appache tomcat.Team Size-Self.</li>
    <li>Inhibiting Histone Biotinylation involve in Cancer Epigenetics by In SilicoApproach: i)Studied the development of Biotin protein ligase structure
        and inhibitors.ii)TechnologyUsed: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool,Iterative Threading Assem bly Refinement.Team Size:3</li>
    <li>Simulation of Pacemaker: i)A comprehensive model of a pacemaker and implemented it on Simulink.ii)Provide input current impulse in case of abnormal heart rate.iii)Technology Used :Matlab and Simulink.Team Size :5</li>
    <li>Next Generation Sequence Data Analysis of colorectal Cancer: i)RNA seq data analysis used to determine genes that were significantly deferentially expressed between tumor and normal samples. ii)Deferentially expressed genes were evaluated and they were associated with many pathways and functions, many of which were associated with cancer and provided insight into the broader carcinogenic process
        .iii)Technologies Used: Fastqc,Bowtie,Cufflinks tool,i-pathway,ncbi databases.Team Size:3</li>
    <li>Simulation of Hodgkin Huxley Model using Matlab : i)With help of matlab tried to provide digital Solution to the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
        ii)Technology Used: Matlab. Team Size:Self</li>
    <li>Automatic Speed Control Car: i)Designed Multi utility speed control system using sensor,Arduino.
        ii)TechnologyUsed:Arduino,Motor,Ultrasonic Sensors.Team Size:4</li>
    <li>Vibrotactile device for deaf and blind: i)Designed the system that consists in sensing the surrounding environment via sonar sensors and sending vibrotactile feedback to the user of the position of the closest obstacles in range.
        ii)Technology Used:IR sensors,Arduino. Team Size:4</li>
